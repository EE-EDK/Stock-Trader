# Stock Trading Signals — Project Mandates — Agent Startup Brief

> **All AI agents read this first.** Project-scoped startup brief for any agent \
> (Claude, Gemini, Grok, Cursor, etc.) entering this project.

## Session Startup

Read project docs in this order (load only what the task needs):

1. **`GROK.md`** — Grok execution context and project mandates (**read first in Grok sessions**)
2. **`AGENTS.md`** — this startup brief
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** — build commands, directory structure, conventions
4. **`GEMINI.md`** — governance mandates (overrides CLAUDE within the same directory tier)

Load only what is scoped to this project; do **not** import sibling project context.


**Doc precedence (same tier):** `GROK.md` → `AGENTS.md` → `CLAUDE.md` → `GEMINI.md`

## Project Identity

- **Free APIs Only:** All data sources must be zero-cost. No paid subscriptions or premium API tiers.
- **Rate Limiting:** Every API collector must implement rate limiting per provider specs. Never exceed documented limits.
- **Data Integrity:** All financial data must flow through SQLite — no CSV or flat-file storage for time-series data.
- **No Invented Signals:** Trading signals must be derived from real API data. Never fabricate or interpolate market data.
- **Secrets Management:** API keys in `config/config.yaml` or `.env` only. These files are gitignored. Never commit credentials.

## Red Lines

- No destructive file operations without explicit user confirmation.
- No commits or pushes without explicit user authorization (END SESSION counts as authorization for its defined scope).
- **Historical preservation:** annotate stale items, never delete resolved records.
- Surgical changes only — minimize blast radius; do not refactor surrounding code unless asked.
- No invented specs, values, or configurations; ground all decisions in datasheets or empirical data.

## Commit Rules

See workspace-level protocol at `ENGINEERING-PROJECTS/AGENTS.md` §Commit Rules.
Summary: do **not** infer "commit and push everything" unless the user explicitly requests it or triggers END SESSION.

## Validation Before Completion

- Always verify with tests, linters, DRC/ERC, or build scripts before declaring done.
- Never claim success without running the relevant verification suite.
